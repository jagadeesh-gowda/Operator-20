Summary of Functionality:

The Operator 20 Indicator is designed to help traders visually identify high momentum bullish setups by detecting either:
  1. A single strong green candle with at least 20% movement, or
  2. A sequence of green candles that collectively move 20% or more from the first green candle's low.
Once the move is confirmed, the indicator marks the entry (green line) and target (red line) levels on the chart.

âœ… How It Works:
![MAZDOCK_2025-04-10_22-07-43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f44091c7-8636-4ea6-9e94-74f4180309af)The indicator tracks green candles (candles where close â‰¥ open). It looks for two patterns:

1. Single Green Candle with â‰¥ 20% Move
   * A single candle with at least 20% move from low to high.
   * The candle is followed by a red candle to confirm the end of the spike.
   * Entry Level: The low of the green candle (marked with a green horizontal line).
   * Target Level: The high of the green candle (marked with a red horizontal line).
   * Labeled as Entry X and Target X.

2. Sequence of Green Candles with Combined Move â‰¥ 20%
   * Multiple consecutive green candles.
   * The total move from the low of the first green candle to the high of the last green candle is â‰¥ 20%.
   * Confirmed when a red candle appears afterward.
   * Entry Level: Low of the first green candle.
   * Target Level: High of the last green candle.

ðŸ“‰ How to Use the Marked Levels
Once the entry and target levels are marked:
  1. Wait for Price to Revisit the Entry (Green Line)
       * Use this level as your buy trigger when the price comes back to that zone in the future.
  2. Target (Red Line)
      * You may consider exiting or taking profit when the price revisits the target level.
